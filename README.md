# Reminduck

Reminduck is a simple reminder app made to be quick and easy - it focuses on simple or recurrent reminders with set time and date and nothing else.

It's perfect if all you want are simple or daily/weekly/monthly reminders. Anything more than that is not achievable by Reminduck right now - but you can help! Open an issue or a pull request if you have any ideas or requests.

_And it quacks._

## Built for elementary OS

While Reminduck can run in any Linux distribution, it was built with [elementary OS] in mind. I appreciate any help packaging it for more distributions, though!

## Translating

You can help translating this app with the following steps:

* Add the language you want to translate to in the `po/LINGUAS` file (if it's already there, you can skip this step);
* Then, make sure the translation files are updated:
```shell
cd build
ninja com.github.matfantinel.reminduck-pot
ninja com.github.matfantinel.reminduck-update-po
```
* Then, update your language file in `po` folder with your translations. For example, portuguese (pt) translation file is `po/pt.po`;
* Fork this repo, commit to your repo and then open a Pull Request to this one.

## Developing and building

If you want to go ahead and compile Reminduck yourself, you'll need the following dependencies:

* libgranite-dev
* libgtk-3-dev
* meson
* valac
* libsqlite3-dev
* gettext

You can install them on elementary OS Juno with:

```shell
sudo apt install elementary-sdk
```

Run `meson build` to configure the build environment and run `ninja install`
to install:

```shell
meson build --prefix=/usr
cd build
sudo ninja install
```

Then run it with:

```shell
com.github.matfantinel.reminduck
```

## Flatpak

```shell
sudo apt install flatpak-builder
flatpak install flathub org.gnome.Sdk/x86_64/3.34
flatpak install flathub org.gnome.Platform/x86_64/3.34
flatpak install flathub io.elementary.BaseApp/x86_64/juno-19.08

cd build && sudo ninja install && cd .. && cd build-aux/flatpak && flatpak-builder --install repo com.github.matfantinel.reminduck.json --force-clean --user
```
